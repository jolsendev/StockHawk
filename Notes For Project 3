User Feedback for Stock Hawk:
Hellen says:
"Right now I can't use this app with my screen reader. My friends love it, so I would love to
download it, but the buttons don't tell my screen reader what they do."

Your boss says:
"We need to prepare Stock Hawk for the Egypt release. Make sure our translators know what to change
and make sure the Arabic script will format nicely."

Adebowale says:
"Stock Hawk allows me to track the current price of stocks, but to track their prices over time, I
need to use an external program. It would be wonderful if you could show more detail on a stock,
including its price over time."

Gundega says:
"I use a lot of widgets on my Android device, and I would love to have a widget that displays my
stock quotes on my home screen."

Jamal says:
"I found a bug in your app. Right now when I search for a stock quote that doesn't exist, the app
crashes."

Xaio-lu says:
"When I opened this app for the first time without a network connection, it was a confusing blank
screen. I would love a message that tells me why the screen is blank or whether my stock quotes are
out of date."
